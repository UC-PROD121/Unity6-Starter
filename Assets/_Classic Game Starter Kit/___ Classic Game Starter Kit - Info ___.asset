  - heading: <b>Contents of this Starter Kit</b>
    text: "Most things can be found in the <b><i>_Classic Game Starter Kit</i></b>
      folder. Read the <b>Instructions Doc</b> (linked above) for much better info
      on each of these. \n\n\u2022 <b>BoundsCamera.cs</b> - A camera that follows
      the player within bounds that are defined by BoxCollider2D triggers (in __Scripts
      folder).\n\n\u2022\_<b>_Prefabs Folder</b>\n  \u2022 <b>Player2D Prefab</b>
      - A player GameObject that uses the GMTK + CGSK Platformer Code\n  \u2022 <b>Stairs
      Prefab</b> - A set of invisible stairs (or ladder) that can be climbed by Player\n 
      \u2022 <b>Xnput Prefab</b> - Once it has been drug into a scene, the <b>Xnput
      Prefab</b> uses the new Unity Input System and NES_InputActions to generate
      data for NES-style controls from a keyboard or gamepad. It is accessed statically
      just like Unity's built-in Input (e.g., Xnput.GetButtonDown(\"Start\")). If
      you select the prefab, you can see the various buttons working when the scene
      is played.\n\n\u2022 <b>Alternate Character Controllers</b> - Several simpler
      character controllers with fewer features\n  \u2022 <b>CharacterController2D</b>
      - This is a simple but effective 2D character controller that is a good starting
      point for developing your own player character controller. It has fewer features
      than the GMTK + CGSK one.\n  \u2022 <b>First Person Controller</b> Folder -
      A first-person controller prefab and demo scene.\n  \u2022 <b>PCC_Grounder</b>
      - The Grounder script from the 2D Platformer Coding Challenge in Spring 2025.\n 
      \u2022 <b>PCC_Player</b> - The Player script from the 2D Platformer Coding
      Challenge in Spring 2025.\n\n\u2022 <b>GMTK + CGSK Platformer Code</b> - This
      is a relatively complex 2D character controller that was initially created
      by GameMakers ToolKit but fixed and heavily modified by Jeremy.\n\n\u2022 <b>Importing
      a Classic Level</b> - Contains the tools for converting an image of a map from
      somewhere like spriters-resource.com into a working Unity Tilemap, which can
      save a ton of space in the final build of your game and make editing the level
      much easier.\n"

  - heading: Character Controller 2D
    text: The character platformer code is a modified version of the GMTK Platformer
      Toolkit. A few <b>Alternate Character Controllers</b> are also included in
      the _CGSK folder.

  - heading: Importing a Classic Level Tilemap Code
    text: This is mostly built on code from the Dungeon Delver project in my book.
      Extensive instructions for using this are in the Instructions Google Doc.

  - heading: NaughtyAttributes - Unity Asset
    text: This project includes the <b>excellent</b> and <b>free</b> NaughtyAttributes
      asset from the Unity Asset Store. NaughtyAttributes was created by Denis Rizov
      to allow some of the same functionality as the (even better but expensive)
      <i>Odin Inspector Tools</i> in a free package.

      Photopea.com, but you can do the same things in Affinity Photo, Photoshop,
      or even Gimp.\t"

  - heading: <b>This is a Work in Progress!</b>
    text: "If you find things that are broken, please let me know. Several things
      are unfinished at this point, and I will be updating them throughout the semester
      and beyond.\n\nIn Fall, 2022, we used the Game Makers ToolKit <i>GMTK Platformer
      Toolkit</i>, which is pretty great as an interactive essay, but I found and
      fixed some bugs in the actual platformer code that they distributed and felt
      that some things could have been done better. When I contacted GMTK about it,
      they said that they had moved on to other projects and weren't interested in
      improving their Toolkit, so I felt that I needed to make my own.\n\nDoing so,
      is taking some time, as all things do.\n     \u2014 <i>Jeremy</i>"
